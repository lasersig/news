# Flutter News App

A Flutter application that displays the latest news articles using the **Clean Architecture** approach and **SOLID** principles.

The app fetches news from a public API and displays them in a list view with titles, thumbnails, and publish dates. Clicking on an article opens a detailed page showing the full content and a link to the original source.

## How SOLID and Clean Architecture Were Applied

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility (S)**  
  Each class handles one responsibility. Example:
    - `NewsApiService` → Handles API calls only.
    - `NewsRepositoryImpl` → Manages data retrieval logic.
    - `HomePage` → Handles only UI rendering.

- **Open/Closed (O)**  
  Adding a new data source (e.g., local database) doesn’t require changing existing classes just create a new implementation of `NewsRepository`.
  —j
- **Liskov Substitution (L)**  
  Any implementation of `NewsRepository` can replace another without breaking the app.

- **Interface Segregation (I)**  
  Interfaces like `NewsRepository` are small and focused.

- **Dependency Inversion (D)**  
  The presentation layer depends on abstract `NewsRepository` instead of a concrete API implementation.

## Clean Architecture

- **Domain Layer**
    - Core business logic: Entities (`Article`), Use Cases (`GetNewsArticles`), Repository interfaces.
- **Data Layer**
    - Handles fetching data from the API, mapping JSON to models, and implementing the repository interface.
- **Presentation Layer**
    - Contains UI pages, widgets, and state management. Fully decoupled from the data source.
